    <h1>Disclaimer of liability
    </h1>

    <h2>Liability for content
    </h2>

    <p>The content of my website has been created with the greatest care. However, I cannot assume any liability for
        the
        correctness, completeness and topicality of the content. As a service provider, I am responsible for my own
        content on
        these pages in accordance with § 7 para.1 TMG (German Telemedia Act) and general laws. According to §§ 8 to 10
        TMG,
        however, I am not obliged as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to
        investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information
        in
        accordance with general legislation remain unaffected by this. However, liability in this respect is only
        possible from
        the time of knowledge of a specific infringement. As soon as I become aware of such infringements, I will remove
        this
        content immediately.</p>

    <h2>Liability for links
    </h2>

    <p>My website contains links to external third-party websites over whose content I have no influence. Therefore,
        I cannot
        accept any liability for this third-party content. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always
        responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at
        the time
        of linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of linking. However, permanent monitoring of the
        content of
        the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of an infringement. If I become aware of any legal
        infringements, I will remove such links immediately.</p>

    <h2>Copyright</h2>

    <p>The content and works created by the site operators on these pages are subject to German copyright law.
        Duplication,
        processing, distribution and any kind of exploitation outside the limits of copyright law require the written
        consent of
        the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are only permitted for private,
        non-commercial use.
        Insofar as the content on this site was not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are
        respected. In
        particular, third-party content is identified as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright
        infringement,
        please inform me accordingly. If I become aware of any infringements, I will remove such content
        immediately.</p>

    <h2>Data protection
    </h2>

    <p>The use of my website is generally possible without providing personal data. Insofar as personal data (e.g.
        name,
        address or e-mail addresses) is collected on our pages, this is always done on a voluntary basis as far as
        possible.
        This data will not be passed on to third parties without your express consent. I would like to point out that
        data
        transmission over the Internet (e.g. when communicating by e-mail) may be subject to security vulnerabilities.
        Complete
        protection of data against access by third parties is not possible. I hereby expressly prohibit the use of
        contact data
        published within the scope of the imprint obligation by third parties for sending unsolicited advertising and
        information material. The operators of the website expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event
        of the
        unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as spam e-mails.</p>
