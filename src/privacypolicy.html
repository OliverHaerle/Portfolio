    <h1> Privacy policy</h1>

    <p>The controller within the meaning of data protection laws, in particular the EU General Data Protection
        Regulation
        (GDPR), is: <br><br> Oliver Härle

    </p> <br><br>

    <h1> Your Rights as an Affected Party </h1>

    <p> You can exercise the following rights at any time using the contact details of our data protection officer:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li> &#8226; Information about your data stored with us and its processing (Art. 15 GDPR),
        </li>
        <li> &#8226; Rectification of inaccurate personal data (Art. 16 GDPR),
        </li>
        <li> &#8226; Erasure of your data stored by us (Art. 17 GDPR),
        </li>
        <li> &#8226; Restriction of data processing if we are not yet permitted to erase your data due to legal obligations (Art.
            18
            GDPR),
        </li>
        <li>&#8226; Objection to the processing of your data by us (Art. 21 GDPR), and
        </li>
        <li>&#8226; Data portability if you have consented to the data processing or have concluded a contract with us (Art. 20
            GDPR).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you have given us your consent, you can revoke it at any time with effect for the future. <br><br>
        You can contact a supervisory authority at any time with a complaint, e.g. the competent supervisory authority
        of
        the federal state of your residence or the authority responsible for us as the responsible body. <br><br>
        A list of supervisory authorities (for the non-public sector) with addresses can be found at:
        https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Service/Anschriften/Laender/Laender-node.html.

    <h1>Collection of general information when visiting our website </h1>

    <h2>Type and purpose of processing:</h2>

    <p>When you access our website, i.e. if you do not register or otherwise transmit information, information of a
        general nature is automatically collected. This information (server log files) includes, for example, the type
        of
        web browser, the operating system used, the domain name of your internet service provider, your IP address and
        similar. <br><br>They are processed for the following purposes in particular:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>&#8226; Ensuring a smooth connection to the website,</li>
        <li>&#8226; Ensuring the smooth use of our website,</li>
        <li>&#8226; Evaluation of system security and stability and</li>
        <li>&#8226; to optimize our website.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We do not use your data to draw conclusions about your person. Information of this kind may be statistically
        evaluated by us anonymously in order to optimize our website and the technology behind it.</p>

    <h2>Legal basis and legitimate interest:</h2>

    <p>Processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR on the basis of our legitimate
        interest in
        improving the stability and functionality of our website.</p>

    <h2>Recipient</h2>
    <p>Recipients of the data may be technical service providers who act as processors for the operation and
        maintenance
        of our website.</p>

    <h2>Storage duration:</h2>
    <p>The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected. This is
        generally the case for the data used to provide the website when the respective session has ended.</p>

    <h2>Provision prescribed or required:</h2>
    <p>The provision of the aforementioned personal data is neither legally nor contractually required. However,
        without
        the IP address, the service and functionality of our website cannot be guaranteed. In addition, individual
        services
        may not be available or may be restricted. For this reason, an objection is excluded.</p> <br><br>

    <h1>Contact form</h1>

    <h2>Type and purpose of processing:</h2>

    <p>The data you enter will be stored for the purpose of individual communication with you. This requires you to
        provide a valid e-mail address and your name. This is used to assign the request and subsequently answer it. The
        provision of further data is optional.</p>

    <h2>Legal basis:</h2>

    <p>The data entered in the contact form is processed on the basis of a legitimate interest (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f
        GDPR). <br><br>

        By providing the contact form, we would like to make it easy for you to contact us. The information you provide
        will
        be stored for the purpose of processing your request and for possible follow-up questions.
        <br><br>
        If you contact us to request a quote, the data entered in the contact form will be processed to carry out
        pre-contractual measures (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR).
    </p>


    <h2>Recipient:</h2>

    <p>Recipients of the data may be processors.</p>

    <h2>Storage duration:</h2>

    <p>Data will be deleted no later than 6 months after the request has been processed. <br><br>

        If there is a contractual relationship, we are subject to the statutory retention periods according to the
        German
        Commercial Code (HGB) and delete your data after these periods have expired.</p>

    <h2>
        Provision prescribed or required:
    </h2>

    <p>The provision of your personal data is voluntary. However, we can only process your request if you provide us
        with
        your name, e-mail address and the reason for the request.</p>

    <h2>SSL-encryption</h2>

    <p>To protect the security of your data during transmission, we use state-of-the-art encryption methods (e.g.
        SSL)
        via HTTPS.</p><br><br>

    <h1>Information about your right to object in accordance with Art. 21 GDPR</h1>

    <h2>Right to object in individual cases</h2>

    <p>You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to processing of
        personal data concerning you which is based on point (f) of Article 6(1) GDPR (data processing on the basis of a
        balancing of interests); this also applies to profiling based on this provision within the meaning of Article
        4(4)
        GDPR.
        <br><br>
        If you object, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate
        grounds
        for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves the
        establishment,
        exercise or defense of legal claims.
    </p>

        or to
        implement changes to our services in the privacy policy, e.g. when introducing new services. The new privacy
        policy
        will then apply to your next visit.</p>
